##Queue implementation
####It's necessary to have the entire repo downloaded for your computer for the queue to work properly because it inherits from LinkedList.

g++ queuetest.cpp -o qtest to compile and ./qtest to run the tests. Fell free to build your own test file for the queue implementation too.

Any problem, please contact me.
