##Stack implementation
####It's necessary to have the entire repo downloaded for your computer for the stack to work properly because it inherits from LinkedList.

g++ stacktest.cpp -o stest to compile and ./stest to run the tests. Fell free to build your own test file for the stack implementation too.

Any problem, please contact me.
